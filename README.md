smart.git
--------------

 > What is it ?
 - The missing link between github issue and Ethereum
  
 > How it works ? 
 - The smart.git will watch over the subscribed issues 
   and once one of the issues will be found as closed
   the smart.git will report to Ethereum contract.
   
```
   # all issues the smart git is watching
   http://smartgit.ether.camp/issues
   
   # subscribe issue for company=ether-camp user=test index=2 
   http://smartgit.ether.camp/issue/save/ether-camp/test/2
```   

- after the github issue will be noticed as close look for a transaction on Ethereum
